installed networkmanager
installed dhclient
installed iwd

make sure you have enabled systemd-resolved
make sure you have NOT enabled systemd-resolved


make the file /etc/iwd/main.conf

and add these fields:

[General]
EnableNetworkConfiguration=true

[Network]
NameResolvingService=systemd


these enable iwd to do dhcp stuff and dns stuff


in file /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/dhcp-client.conf
add these to tell networkmanager to use dhclient instead of internal dhcp client:

[main]
dhcp=dhclient



in file /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/dns.conf
add these to tell networkmanager explicitly which dns to use(although systemd-resolved is the default):

[main]
dns=systemd-resolved
